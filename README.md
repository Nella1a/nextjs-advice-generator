# nextjs-advice-generator-app

This project is inspired by a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) challenge, which involves creating an advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/).

I extended the challenge to enhance my skills in working with APIs and dockerizing applications. In addition to fetching general advice, I've implemented features like searching for advice by keyword and saving or deleting advice in a PostgreSQL database. I've also dockerized the app as part of my learning process. Additionally, I built this app with a different tech stack to further expand my practice. You can find the React version of the advice generator app [here](https://github.com/Nella1a/react-advice-generator-app).
