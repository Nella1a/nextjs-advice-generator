# nextjs-advice-generator-app

This project is inspired by a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) challenge, which involves creating an advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API] (https://api.adviceslip.com/). I expanded the challenge to improve my skills in working with APIs and dockerizing applications. Beyond just fetching general advice, I've added features like searching for advice by keyword and saving or deleting advice in a PostgreSQL database. I've also dockerized the app as part of my learning experience and  built this app using a different tech stack to gain more practice. You can find the React version of the advice generator app [here](https://github.com/Nella1a/react-advice-generator-app).
